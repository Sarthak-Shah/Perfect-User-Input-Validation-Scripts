"""when we have significant database, we do require sorting of data. ex, arranging client insurance due by date,
rank wise class performance, department wise employee sorting.
So it's an essential task.
Due to tunneling view of computer systems + comparison operator handles 2 values at a time, we need to design
sorting algorithm accordingly. Like humans, computer can't process multiple attributes at same time, like you can
easily find the shortest persons from 1 row in 1 look.

"""
Radix sort: base (used) for sorting. non comparison algorithm.
space and time complexity depends on max length of digit from array. 
start from RSB or LSB iterate through it and allocate it into respective bucket(bin) ex. 0 to 9 for base 10.

time complexity: Radix sort has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the size of the input list and m is the maximum 
number of digits in the elements of the list.
Therefore, itâ€™s not necessarily that O(n*m) is always faster than O(n*log(n)). It depends on the comparison between m 
and log(n).
space complexity: Radix sort has a space complexity of O(n + b), where n is the size of the input list and b is the 
base (radix) used for sorting. Because the algorithm requires additional space to store the list of buckets used to 
sort the elements.
